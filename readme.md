Recipe video above. An Indian lamb curry to die for! A heady combination of intense spices in a creamy tomato curry sauce, the lamb is fall apart tender and packs a serious flavour punch. While this recipe calls for a lengthy list of spices, you won't need to take a trip to an Indian store to get them - they're even sold at my local grocery store!
Ingredients
▢3.5 tbsp ghee , substitute butter (Note 1)
▢1 cinnamon stick
▢6 green cardamom pods , lightly bruised
▢4 cloves
▢1 large onion , finely chopped
▢3 cloves garlic , finely minced
▢1 tbsp ginger , finely grated
▢5 tbsp tomato passata (US: tomato puree/sauce, Note 5)
▢1 tsp salt
▢750g/1.5lb boneless lamb shoulder , cut into 3cm/1.2" cubes (Note 6)
▢1.5 cups / 375ml chicken stock , salt reduced (broth)
SPICES:
▢2 tbsp paprika , normal or sweet
▢3/4 tsp chilli powder (or to taste, Note 2)
▢4 tsp ground coriander
▢4 tsp ground cumin
▢2 tsp turmeric powder
▢1/4 tsp nutmeg
▢1 tsp garam marsala (Note 3)
▢1/2 tsp fennel powder (Note 4)
FINISHES
▢1/2 tsp extra garam masala (Note 3)
▢1/2 tsp extra fennel powder
SERVING/GARNISH
▢1/2 cup / 125g plain yoghurt (Greek yogurt fine)
▢Chopped coriander leaves, finely shredded ginger, yogurt
▢Basmati rice
Instructions

Melt ghee over medium heat in large heavy based pot. Add cinnamon, cardamom and cloves and cook for one minute.
Add onion and cook for 7 minutes, stirring frequently, until pieces are golden and starting the brown on the edges.
Add the garlic and ginger, cook for another minute.
Stir in the Spices, cook for 30 seconds.
Mix in the tomato puree and salt, then add stock and mix.
Add lamb, stir, bring to simmer.
Place lid on and adjust heat to low or medium low so it's simmering gently.
Cook 1 hour 45 minutes, giving it an occasional stir, until lamb is quite tender - use 2 forks to check, it should pry apart pretty easily.
Remove lid, and continue cooking for another 15 minutes (to reduce sauce slightly) - lamb should be very tender by this stage.
Stir in the Yogurt, the Extra garam marsala and fennel. Cook for another few minutes.
Serve with basmati rice, sprinkled with fresh coriander leaves and other garnishes if desired. More sides (pictured): Cucumber salad (Note 7) and Easy naan - No Yeast Flatbread
Recipe Notes:
1. Ghee is pure butter (butter is actually fat + water), has more intense butter flavour than normal butter. Sold at large grocery stores in Australia, sub with butter.
2. Chilli powder - this is pure chilli and it's spicy. This is not "Chili Powder" as sold in the US which is a spice mix and not that spicy.
3. Garam masala - Indian spice mix sold at large grocery stores nowadays. Sub with curry powder.
4. Fennel powder – This is simply ground fennel seeds. If you can only find fennel seeds, toast them carefully on a dry skillet. Then grind using a spice grinder or mortar and pestle. 1 tsp fennel seeds will roughly yield 1/2 tsp of fennel powder. If you cannot find either ground or whole fennel seeds, you can leave this out.
5. Tomato passata – Plain pureed tomato. In the US it's called "tomato puree" - also what's called "tomato sauce" is fine to use (eg Hunts) (Aussies/UK - do not use what we call tomato sauce!).
Substitute: 1 tbsp tomato paste mixed with 4 tbsp water + 1/2 tsp sugar. Or puree canned tomato and measure out 5 tbsp.
6. Lamb - shoulder is best, it's marbled with fat so it's beautifully juicy once slow cooked until fall apart tender. Trim big hunks of fat but leave some. You want 750g of lamb after trimming.
Do not use leg or other lean cut, it will be dry.
If using bone in, get one around 1.1 - 1.2kg then cut meat off the bone.
7. Cucumber Salad pictured in post - use this Herb & Garlic Cucumber Salad, but I cut the cucumber into thicker chunks (for juicier bites), skipped the herb & garlic (the curry has enough flavour!) and sprinkled with coriander.
8. Storage and reheating - Keeps up to 5 days in the fridge, or 3 months in the freezer. Like all stews and braises, it's even better the next day! Reheat on the stove or in the microwave. If it seems a little thick, loosen with stock if you have some left, else just water. Adjust seasoning if required – sometimes they need a small salt bump the next day.
